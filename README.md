# ShowroomProject
My Project code aims to simulate a showroom experience where users can choose a brand and view corresponding bike details and forms.

## Language:
  => Core Java
  
## Explanation:
The provided code appears to be a Java program simulating a bike showroom. It includes classes for different bike brands such as Yamaha, KTM, and Honda, along with their respective models and specifications.

Here's a breakdown of the code structure:

The program starts with the Showroom class, which acts as the main entry point. It prompts the user to select a brand (Yamaha, KTM, or Honda) and then calls the appropriate methods based on their choice.

The YamahaBike, KtmBike, and HondaBike classes extend their respective brand classes (Yamaha, Ktm, and Honda) and implement brand-specific logic for displaying bike models and specifications.

The brand classes (Yamaha, Ktm, and Honda) define methods to display the specifications of different bike models. Each method takes in parameters such as name, price, speed, mileage, engine, and color and prints out the details.

The Forms class is not provided, so it is assumed to be a parent class that contains common methods or functionality shared by the brand classes.

The program takes user input using the Scanner class to determine the brand and bike model selection.

The main method is present in each class to create objects and invoke the respective methods.

In this code, Jovi is an AI-like tool. It can help you to pick your devil.
